</head>
<body>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of any website, app, service, technology, API, widget, platform, channel or any other products or features owned, operated, branded or offered by Wampis (“Wampis” or the “Service”), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. For the purposes of these Terms, “we” or “us” refers to the party with whom you are entering into this agreement, per Section 13(e) (Parties). Please read these Terms carefully, and contact us if you have any questions.

        You may not use the Service to do or share anything that is contrary to these Terms. For clarity, these Terms include, and incorporate by reference, the following policies:
        
        Our Community Guidelines, which explain what is and isn’t allowed on Wampis;
        Our Advertising Guidelines and Merchant Guidelines, which explain additional policies that apply to ads and merchants on Wampis; and
        Our Enforcement practices, which explain how we put our policies into practice, including restrictions we may impose on your content on or use of Wampis.
        By accessing or using Wampis, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to our Terms, you must not access or use Wampis.</p>

        <B><p>1. The Service</p></B>

    <p>Wampis helps to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. To do that, we show you things we think will be relevant, interesting and personal to you based on your onsite and offsite activity. To provide the Service, we need to be able to identify you and your interests, and we use your personal data to do this. For more information, please read our Privacy Policy. Some of the things we show you are promoted by advertisers. As part of the Service we try to ensure that even promoted content is relevant and interesting to you. You can identify promoted content because it will be clearly labeled.</p>
        <B><p>2. Using Wampis</p></B>

        <p>You may use Wampis only if you follow these Terms and all applicable laws. Using Wampis may include downloading software to your computer, phone, tablet or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and these Terms will apply to any updates. When you create your Wampis account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information.

            Any use or access to Wampis by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you are older than 13, you can use Wampis if you are over the minimum age of consent in your country. If you are 13 to 18, you may only use the Service with the permission of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you.
            
            If we’ve previously disabled your account for violating these Terms, any of our policies or for legal reasons, you will not create a new Wampis account without our express written permission, which is provided at our sole discretion.
            
            In using Wampis, you agree not to scrape, collect, search, copy or otherwise access data or content from Wampis in unauthorized ways, such as by using automated means (without our express prior permission), or access or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.
            
            You may not use, access, download, or otherwise make available the Service (including related software), except as authorized by applicable trade restrictions, including but not limited to US, EU and UK sanctions and export controls. You agree not to use the Service for any purpose prohibited by applicable trade restrictions.
            
            Any use of Wampis not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.</p>
        <B><p>3. Your User Content</p></B>

        <p>Wampis allows you to post content, including photos, videos, comments, links, and other materials. For the purpose of these Terms, anything that you post or otherwise make available on Wampis is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Wampis. All User Content must comply with these Terms and our policies, including our Community Guidelines.

            You will only post User Content that you have the rights to post, and you won’t post User Content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement or counterfeit), or that is otherwise unlawful, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law. We can take action against User Content that violates these Terms or our policies or where we are permitted or required by law, such as by removing, restricting, or limiting access to, or distribution of, the content. We can also suspend or terminate accounts of users who repeatedly or seriously infringe third-party intellectual property rights, violate the law, these Terms, or our policies, or where permitted or required to do so by law. We are a neutral intermediary and we do not review all User Content before or after it is published on the Service, so we are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other Wampis user. For more information about how we enforce our policies or otherwise take action on content on Wampis, see our Enforcement page. Where appropriate, you may appeal the decisions you think were made in error. You may have a right under local law to bring a claim for breach of contract if you believe we have breached these Terms by removing, restricting or limiting access to, or distribution of, your User Content, or suspending or terminating your account. Wampis cannot provide you with legal advice.</p>
