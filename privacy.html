    <B><p>Scope of the Privacy Policy</p></B>
    <p>When you use Wampis websites, apps, services, technologies, APIs, widgets, or any other products or features we offer (“Wampis” or the “Services”), you voluntarily share certain information.

        Account Information: When you join our Services, we collect information like your name, email address, birthday, gender, country of residence, your interests, and preferred language. If you have a business account, depending on where you live, you may also have the option to add race and ethnicity information to your profile.
        Content: We collect information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content (for example, commenting or adding a Pin), or where you send messages and interact with other users.
        Precise location information: Depending on where you live, you can choose to share your precise location using your device settings.
        Your communications with us: If you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we collect the content of these communications.
        Your contacts: If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your account, we will continue to process certain information about your contacts who are Wampis users to help you find one another on our Services.</p>

<P> When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Wampis. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

    Device information: We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the type of device, operating system, network service provider, settings, and unique device identifiers.
    Log data: When you use our Services, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, activity on websites you visit that incorporate Wampis features (like the “Save” button) browser type and settings, and the date and time of when you accessed the Services. You can learn more about the log data we collect here.
    Information from cookies and similar technologies: We also use “cookies” or similar technologies to obtain log data. For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Wampis. For more information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookie Policy.
    Usage data and inferences. When you’re on our Services, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click on, terms you search for, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with other information you’ve provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer other information, such as your education or professional experience.
    Location Information: We use your IP address to infer your approximate location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location, and photos you share may include information about the location where they were taken.
    User Choices: We will keep a record of choices you’ve selected in your settings, including privacy settings and whether you have enabled notifications.</P>

<p>Third party platforms: If you register for or log into the Service using a third party platform (like Facebook or Google), they will furnish certain information to us to facilitate your account creation or log-in with us. In addition, if you connect your third-party accounts to our Services, we may use information from those accounts to improve your experience. Further, some third-party applications use Wampis features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps, including usage data.
    Technical service partners: We sometimes receive information about you from technical service partners, including from marketing firms.
    Advertisers or other partners: Online advertisers or third parties share information with us about you to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Wampis, or to help us better understand what kinds of ads to show you on Wampis. For example, we may receive information about your visits to an advertiser's site, or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads on the Service. Sometimes we get this information through the Wampis Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site), which delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on our Services. Learn more about the Wampis Tag and the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.</p>
